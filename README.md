### Notes: 
1. Every program contains a loop used for repeating the whole program without requirement for executing the program again. When prompted to repeat the program, an input of 1 will repeat the program, whilst any other integer would end the execution.
2. Every program contains protection from infinite looping within the base main() function and will terminate the program after 15 iterations which can protect against infinite looping.
